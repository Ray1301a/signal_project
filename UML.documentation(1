The alert generation system continuously monitors patients in the cardiovascular unit, triggering alerts for medical staff based on individualized thresholds. It comprises three main classes: AlertGenerator, Alert, 
and AlertManager. The AlertGenerator processes data streams from devices like blood pressure and oxygen saturation monitors, comparing them against personalized thresholds stored in the Cardiovascular Health Management
  System (CHMS). When a threshold is exceeded, an Alert object is instantiated. The Alert class encapsulates relevant information about the generated alert, facilitating communication between the AlertGenerator and 
  AlertManager. The AlertManager oversees the distribution of alerts, ensuring they reach the appropriate medical staff or devices promptly for necessary medical intervention.
